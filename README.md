# Simple-Console-Log
A simple logging system for your website on repl.it that logs the current version and updates in the console.

This is a very simple template mainly for repl.it, and it adds a version and description in your website console.
There is also a section to save later versions for you to look back to.

# How to add
Adding is very simple, and you only need a few lines of code to get started!

First, clone the github onto a new replit by using replit's add github feature.
Once it is finished copying it will ask for you to set what the run button does. Just set this to the default.

Second, add this line of code at the bottom of your main html file of your website
<script src=''></script>
You still need to surround this by html and body code.
You will also need to add your replit website from the github into this code, but there is an extra step.

Lets say my website name was https://websitescript.example111.repl.co
I would have to add /analytics.js at the end, so it would look like this: https://websitescript.example111.repl.co/analytics.js
What this is doing is making sure it only takes the analytics.js file (the logging file) and not the whole website.

# Adding Past Logging
In this github there are 2 main files. analytics.js and index.html. I already said that the analytics.js is just doing the logging to the console, but what is the index.html there for? It is your website for past update logs.

In index.html there will already be a ready to go header code, and a body code for the text. What you need to do is fill it out with all your information. If you need to add more than 1 log, or have more all you need to do is copy and paste the empty code for the text and add to it!

# More info
This was made by me, nomad.
I am a semi-experienced coder that does node.js, html, css, and js for websites. 
This was made mainly to make it easier to get a reliable logging template. If you have any problems, suggetions, or comments make sure to put them in an issue and I can look at them.
Have a nice day!
